# Prank-App-Mac
An prank app that shows a line (represents a hair / damaged display) that does not show up on Dock.app or Force Quit App UI.

This app is only compatible with macOS Sierra and later (10.12 - 11.0). Do not request for compatibility with El Capitan and earlier as the app will not work properly and is a waste of time.

If you would like to close the app, you must go to Activity Monitor and close the app named 'Prank'. The app won't show up on the Dock or Force Quit App UI therefore not being able to be closed.

I am not responsible for the damage of you're Mac if it is either corrupted or damaged. No warranty is INCLUDED.
